* Whisper Engine - The Emacs-powered Static Site Generator
[[https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT][https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg]]

*Whisper Engine*: Minimalist, Emacs-powered static site generator. No JS. No telemetry. No noise.

Only one-way signal for those who require simplicity.

Current Whisper Engine version: *0.0.8*

*The Whisper Engine is under development.*

** Features

- Minimalist: No JS, no telemetry, no noise
- Pure Emacs Lisp, zero external dependencies
- Paginated index pages
- Automatic article sorting by date
- Teaser + thumbnail support
- Clears static directory before rebuild (no leftover files)

** Requirements

- Emacs 28.1 or newer
- Org Mode 9.5 or newer
- libxml

** Configuration & customization

The =whisper-engine.el= file is self-contained.
The top of the file contains a couple of configuration variables.

You can configure them in-place.

The =ds/public-article-dir= variable is a /full-path/ to a directory.
This is the target for the generated HTML and the static pages, images.
This directory is presented by the web server.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar ds/public-article-dir "/path/to/public-html-dir"
  "Public directory where the HTML files will be generated.")
#+end_src

The =ds/org-article-dir= variable is a /full-path/ to a directory.
This is the Whisper Engine input as Org Mode article files.
They have special keywords and properties.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar ds/org-article-dir "/path/to/private-org-file-dir"
  "The org file dir. Article sources are here.")
#+end_src

The =ds/index-title= configures the title of the index pages.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar ds/index-title "Ghost Operator Whispers"
  "Title of the index page.")
#+end_src

The =ds/posts-per-page= configures how many articles are shown on the index page.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar ds/posts-per-page 6
  "This option sets how many articles are presented on the index page.")
#+end_src

The =ds/site-url= configures the URL of the generated site.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar ds/site-url "https://site-url.tld"
  "The URL of the site.")
#+end_src

You can customize the footer with changing the =footer= variable in the source.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(footer "<footer><p>© 2025 DeadSwitch | The Whisper Engine | All rights reserved.</p></footer>")
#+end_src

** Org File Metadata - Keywords And Properties

The Whisper Engine is powered by *Emacs Org Mode*.

Org files are the engine of the tool in the =ds/org-article-dir= directory.

The following *keywords* configure the exported articles:

#+begin_src org
#+TITLE: Article Title
#+AUTHOR: DeadSwitch | The Cyber Ghost
#+DATE: <2025-05-23 Fri>
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil num:nil \n:t
#+READY_FOR_DEPLOY: nil
#+end_src

Only the =#+READY_FOR_DEPLOY: t= articles are exported to HTML and used on the site.

The =#+DATE: <2025-05-23 Fri>= keyword affects the order of the articles on the index page.
Newer articles are on the top.

The following *properties* must be set to the *first headline* of the article Org Files:

#+begin_src org
:TEASER: Short teaser to show on the index page.
:IMAGE: /static/img/image.jpg
#+end_src

The relative path to the image in the =:IMAGE:= property is a thumbnail for the index page.
