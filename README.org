** Requirements

- Emacs 28.1 or newer
- Org Mode 9.5 or newer

** Configuration & customization

The =whisper-engine.el= file is self-contained.
The top of the file contains a couple of configuration variables.

You can configure them in-place.

The =ds/cache-file= variable is a /full-path/ to the cache file
for incremental site building. SHA256 is used to spot file changes.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar ds/cache-file "/path/to/whisper-cache.el"
  "Path to the Whisper Engine cache file storing file hashes and HTML paths.")
#+end_src

The =ds/public-article-dir= variable is a /full-path/ to a directory.
This is the target for the generated HTML and the static pages, images.
This directory is presented by the web server.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar ds/public-article-dir "/path/to/public-html-dir"
  "Public directory where the HTML files will be generated.")
#+end_src

The =ds/org-article-dir= variable is a /full-path/ to a directory.
This is the Whisper Engine input as Org Mode article files.
They have special keywords and properties.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar ds/org-article-dir "/path/to/private-org-file-dir"
  "The org file dir. Article sources are here.")
#+end_src

The =ds/index-title= configures the title of the index pages.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar ds/index-title "Ghost Operator Whispers"
  "Title of the index page.")
#+end_src

The =ds/posts-per-page= configures how many articles are shown on the index page.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar ds/posts-per-page 6
  "This option sets how many articles are presented on the index page.")
#+end_src

The =ds/site-url= configures the URL of the generated site.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar ds/site-url "https://site-url.tld"
  "The URL of the site.")
#+end_src

You can customize the /footer/, the /navigation bar/ and the /base html template/ with the
following variables:

- =ds/html-nav=
- =ds/html-footer=
- =ds/base-html-template=

** Org File Metadata - Keywords And Properties

The Whisper Engine is powered by *Emacs Org Mode*.

Org files are the engine of the tool in the =ds/org-article-dir= directory.

The following *keywords* configure the exported articles:

#+begin_src org
#+TITLE: Article Title
#+AUTHOR: DeadSwitch | The Cyber Ghost
#+DATE: <2025-05-23 Fri>
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil num:nil \n:t
#+CATEGORY: Article category
#+TAGS: #WhisperEngine #Emacs #OrgMode #StaticSiteGenerator #DeadSwitch 
#+IMAGE: /path/to/img.jpg
#+TEASER: Article teaser
#+READY_FOR_DEPLOY: nil
#+end_src

Only the =#+READY_FOR_DEPLOY: t= articles are exported to HTML and used on the site.

The =#+DATE: <2025-05-23 Fri>= keyword affects the order of the articles on the index page.
Newer articles are on the top.

The =#+IMAGE:= keyword configures a thumbnail of the article on the index page.

** Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:

   #+begin_src bash
   git clone https://github.com/deadswitch404/whisper-engine.git

2. Open =whisper-engine.el= in Emacs and configure:
   - =ds/org-article-dir=
   - =ds/public-article-dir=
